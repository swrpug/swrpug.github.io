The Southwest Riverside Python Users Group Site has launched.  I was able to spend some time figuring out how to setup github pages.  Many thanks to this tutorial [github pages](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages).  This will be a great way to keep members informed about the group activities.  Using the github we can also collect open source projects and make class resource available.

Still there is a lot of work to do, like learning [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and, of course, keeping up with everything.

We have a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Southwest-Riverside-Python-Users-Group-Meetup/) which has details about our bi-weekly meetings.
