Happy Two Month Anniversary.  The Southwest Riverside Python Users Group was
established on Jan 28th, 2017.  Since then we have held a number of beginner
Python classes and several presentations from important speakers in the Python
community, full disclosure, the presentations were videos of presentations from
other venues :-).

Recently, a member suggested a group project involving analysis of small farm
operational and control data, primarily irrigation data.  The suggestion was to
using Python and machine learning prediction and classification to draw high-level
conclusions about the success or failure of watering sessions.  Such capability
could contribute to minimizing water usage, maximizing crop yield, and making
small farming more profitable.  

Time-series data analysis using machine learning is a heavily researched topic
today and this sounds like a great project for the group and anyone looking for
a place to make a mark in machine learning.  If you are interested, please feel
free to contact us.  We will be creating a project on our github page with more
details about the project.
