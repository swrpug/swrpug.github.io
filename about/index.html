title: About Southwest Riverside Python Users Group

		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			The Southwest Riverside Python Users Group was founded to promote the Python language and provide a local resource for
      teaching and learning.  There are a number of Python Users Groups in Southern California, <a href=https://www.meetup.com/iepython/>Riverside</a>,
			<a href=https://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/>San Diego</a>, and <a href=https://www.meetup.com/OCPython/>Orange County</a>, but
			for those living in Southwest Riverside County, these groups are typically about an hour away making attendance difficult.
			It is hoped that the Southwest Riverside Python Users Group will satisfy the needs for those living in the Murrieta/Temecula/Lake
			Elsinore area.
      </p>

			<h1>Meetings</h1>
			<p>
			The Southwest Riverside Python Users Group meets at Murrieta Innovation Center Lab (MIC Lab) located in the
			<a href=https://www.innovatemurrieta.org/>Murrieta Innovation Center</a>.  The MIC Lab is operated by
			<a href=http://creatorspaces.org/>The Civilized Frontier, Inc (a non-profit education foundation)</a>.  At present, there
			are two bi-weekly meetings being held.  On alternate Wednesday evenings, classes for newcommers to Python and programming
			are provided.  All experience levels are welcome.  There is no specific training agenda.  We will adjust to your level and move forward.
			On alternate Saturday mornings, we present advanced topics and interesting features and usage of Python.  Anyone can attend these meetings but the
			more experience you have with Python the more you will get out of the session.  See our <a href=https://www.meetup.com/Southwest-Riverside-Python-Users-Group-Meetup/>Meetup</a>
			for location and specific dates and times.
			</p>

			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>
			Recognizing that 'doing' is often more instructive than just listening, the Southwest Riverside Python Users Group also
			collaborates with members and guests to develop group projects.  See the <a href=../projects>Projects</a> page for more information.
			</p>

			<h1>Associated Groups</h1>
			<p>
			In addition to our group, there are several other technology groups in the area that also meet at the
			<a href=https://www.innovatemurrieta.org/>Murrieta Innovation Center</a>.  Check them out!
