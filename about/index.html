		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>The Southwest Riverside Python Users Group was founded to promote the Python language and provide a local resource for 
         teaching and learning.  There are a number of Python Users Groups in Southern California - Riverside, San Diego, and
         Orange County.  For those living in Southwest Riverside County, these group are typically about an hour away making 
         attendance difficult.  It is hoped that the Southwest Riverside Python Users Groupt will satisfy the needs for those 
         living in the Murrieta/Temecular/Lake Elsinore area
      </p>
